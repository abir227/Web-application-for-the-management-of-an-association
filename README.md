# Summer Project
 As part of our first academic year summer project  we developed a web application utilizing the following technologies:

React JS
Node JS
Express JS
MongoDB

The primary objective of this web application was to assist a local organization called "AGIM" in resource management and facilitate communication between their offices. Additionally, the application provided a platform for individuals to join the organization by completing a form within the application or gaining insights about the organization.
